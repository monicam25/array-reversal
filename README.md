# About my Array Reversal project
This is my simple array reversal project written in C++. It takes in user input for a number of elements for an array and then gathers further user input for that amount of integers to add to the array. Once the total number of integers have been added, the program reverses the elements in the array and then prints them out in this newly reversed order.
